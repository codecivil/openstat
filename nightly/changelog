* minor adaptations

v1.2.2
======
12.05.2020

* bugfix timeout: logout does now properly redirect to login page, independent of the current task

v1.2.1
======
11.05.2020

* bugfix: attributions to minor tables vie drag&drop did not work, since there is a confusion of strings and arrays; workaround: test if it is array and make it one if not in dbAction()


v1.2.0
=======
07.05.2020

* adaptations for using promises for async functions, mainly: callFunction returns a promise which are chained in order to preserve order of calls; no postponing any more...

06.05.2020

* config load works now rather properly (if the users pc is not too old...); alas, the current setTimeout in the config load button's onClick should be recoded to some promise/async stuff
* callFunction postpones calls now while executing; this should resolve the remaining config save problems
* updateOS corrected again

======
03.05.2020

* os.sql for sql installation

19.2.2020

v1.1.3
======

17.2.2020

* replace fieldsets by divs: firefox cannot distribute fieldsets to more than one printing page, so printing of large forms was not possible

* new functionality: importCSV for multiple tables, exportCSV
* new function scope: RESULTDETAILS, used for exportCSV
